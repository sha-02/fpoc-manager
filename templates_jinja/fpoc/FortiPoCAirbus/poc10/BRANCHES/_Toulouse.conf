# The Hub must be able to detect link failures on Edge devices, in order to withdraw the loopback routes injected by exchange-ip-addrv4.
# Furthermore, for certain transition scenarios, it is important that the Hub detects such failures faster than other Edge devices
# (for example, those that had an active ADVPN shortcut towards the failed link).
# This will allow the Hub to quickly detect a failed overlay on a Spoke, to avoid resolving routes via dead overlays.
# Therefore, we enable DPD (on-idle) and we ensure that the DPD timers on Hubs are shorter than those on the Edge devices.

# Recommendations for optimizing failover are:
# - BGP timers longer than DPD
# - DPD on Hub is on-idle
# - DPD on Hub must be shorter than DPD on Branch

################# BGP #####################################################################################

# CONTEXT = No ADVPN for VRF-RED, ADVPN is only for port5.VRF and VRF-BLUE
#
# - "No ADVPN" can mean two things:
#   (1) There will not be any branch-to-branch traffic (e.g, ATMs in VRF-RED)
#       In this case, VRF-RED branches simply need to receive the subnets from the DataCenters (10.{1|2|4}.0.0/16)
#       For simplicity, we can also simply send a global LAN summary (10.0.0.0/8) to the VRF-RED branches
#   (2) There should hardly be any branch-to-branch traffic (but it can happen)
#       VRF-RED branches need to reach the DC subnets but also other branches in VRF-RED
#       The global LAN summary (eg, 10.0.0.0/8) is sent
#
# - HUBS must advertise a global LAN summary route (10.0.0.0/8) into VRF-RED EDGE
#   as well as a summary route for its DataCenter (W-DC1 = 10.1.0.0/26, W-DC2= 10.2.0.0/16)
#   these two DC-specific subnets are needed because the SD-WAN rule mixes DC1+DC2 with 'fib-best-match'
#   so we need a more specific route for each DC in order to send the traffic to the correct DC
# - These summaries (global LAN and DCs LANs) must not be advertised to other regions -> restricted with 'no-export' community
# - HUB must filter VPNV4 prefixes with RT 65000:2 towards the EDGE
# - But the summary routes, which also have RT 65000:2 must be allowed so the summary is tagged with 'tag 32768'
#   when it is injected to BGP
# - summaries are added by means of static blackhole routes because:
#   . it is not possible to apply a route-map when creating an aggregate so cannot add tag 32768
#   . if an aggregate is used, the summary is not limited to VRF-RED

# Inject the summary routes (10.0.0.0/8, 10.{1|2}.0.0/16) in VRF-RED into the BGP table
# Add 'no-export' so that these summaries are only announced to EDGE (iBGP) and not announced to another REGION (eBGP)

### BGP loopback reachability

# The loopback addresses of the Edge branches below Toulouse (Nantes/10.200.1.2 and Greenlog/10.200.1.3)
# must be propagated up to the Paris-Hub so that it can resolve the BGP NH of the prefixes from these two branches
# Likewise, these local branches must know to reach PARIS-DC loopback (10.200.1.254) via Toulouse loopback (10.200.1.1)
# Toulouse generates its own global loopback summary (10.200.0.0/16) and sends it to its Branches
# this global loopback summary is filtered out towards PARIS-DC (H1_OUT)

# Create the bgp global loopback summary with static routes
# aggregation cannot be used because it would prevent Toulouse itself to join the Hub via 10.200.0.0/16
# for the BGP NH prefixes coming from other branches (Dubling, Yellow, ...).
# Toulouse still needs to reach non-directly-connected loopbacks via PARIS-DC
