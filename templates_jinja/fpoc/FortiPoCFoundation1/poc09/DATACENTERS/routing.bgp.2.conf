{% if bgp_route_reflection and bgp_aggregation %} {# legacy ADVPN with cross-region shortcuts: shortcut_routing=='exchange_ip' and regional_advpn and *NO* cross_region_advpn #}
# CONTEXT:
# - BGP route reflection for legacy ADVPN routing (shortcut_routing=='exchange_ip')
# - Regional ADVPN
# - *No* Cross-region shortcuts (aggregation is possible between regions)
#
# Solution:
# - eBGP for cross-region peerings (no need for BGP NH preservation)
# - a single BGP peering between DCs (no need to have one BGP peering per overlay)
# - Only local-region prefixes are needed on a Branch to build intra-region ADVPN shortcuts
# - Prefixes from other regions (edges and DCs) are aggregated under summary 10.0.0.0/14 which covers all LAN/DC subnets
#   summary 10.0.0.0/14 is advertised to edges via a BGP aggregate
# - intra-region BGP NH reachability (10.200.0.0/14 over all overlays) is advertise via BGP since BGP NH recursion
#   via BGP is available as of 7.0

# Route-maps
#

# Ideally the Hub/DC of a region should advertise a summary for its whole region to other regions.
# For e.g., DC3 would get a summary for West region from DC1 and DC2. Then DC3 would pass this summary to its edges
# Here, the address plan does not allow to summarize West region and East region without overlap.
# That's what might happen as well on real networks with no nice-and-clean summarizable IP plan.
# So, here, DC1/DC2 send all there edge subnets to DC3 which summarize them in a big 10.0.0.0/14 summary which is the
# "corporate summary" which encompasses all corporate subnets of all regions.
# A summary 10.200.0.0/14 is also advertised by DC3 to its edges to cover cross-overlay BGP NH reachability.
# Same logic applies on DC1/DC3 for DC3's edge subnets
# The summary routes (corporate= 10.0.0.0/14 and cross-overlay BGP NH reachability 10.200.0.0/14) must not be advertised
# to other regions
# Routes learned from East region (DC3 10.3.0.0/24, BR3 10.0.3.0/24) must not be advertised to West Edges.
# Only the corporate summary (10.0.0.0/14) is sent to West branches.
# Branches of one region do not need to know details about other regions since there is no cross-region shortcuts
# 'tag 666' is used to mark routes received from another region. Routes with this tag are not advertised to local edges
