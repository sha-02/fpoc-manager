{% else %} {# vrf_aware_overlay #}
# if direct_internet_access and vrf_aware_overlay then the config is quite complex.
# For explanation, let's consider LAN_BLUE in VRF 3 and WAN VRF in VRF 32
# VRF 3 has multiple default routes:
#   - one static default route over the inter-vrf link BLUE_1 for DIA via the WAN VRF
#   - multiple static default routes over the tunnels for RIA (MPLS tunnels and possibly INET tunnels)
# RIA traffic can be routed directly to the RIA tunnels within VRF 3 itself, easy...
# But DIA traffic has to be forwarded via BLUE_1 to WAN-VRF
# The problem is that the WAN-VRF has two Internet accesses: Internet_1 and Internet_2
# In VRF3 there is only a single link to reach Internet: BLUE_1
# We need to measure the SLA for DIA and for RIA because we need to prefer DIA and switchover to RIA if needed
# However if we configure a single SLA health-check for Internet server (198.18.8.8) over BLUE_1 then we don't know
# if this HC traffic will egress over Internet_1 or Internet_2 once in the WAN-VRF
# We cannot measure the quality of both Internet_1 and Internet_2 with a single SLA HC sent over BLUE_1
# If we do so and the traffic egress via Internet_1 in WAN-VRF then, as soon as Internet_1 SLA is BAD, then traffic
# will stop going DIA over BLUE_1 and will go RIA over the tunnels in VRF 3
# Basically, if only one Internet link is bad in the WAN-VRF then VRF 3 switches to RIA instead of continuing to do
# DIA via the remaining good Internet link in VRF-WAN
# We need a way to measure the SLA of both Internet_1 and Internet_2 by sending SLA HC over BLUE_1
# The solution is to sent SLA HC to two distinct servers: 198.18.8.8 and 198.18.8.9
# The first server is used to measure the SLA of the RIA tunnels, Internet_1, Internet_2, plus BLUE_1 "via" Internet_1
# The second server is used to measure the SLA of BLUE_1 "via" Internet_2
# HC for .8 over Internet_1 and Internet_2 is done by the WAN-VRF
# HC for .8 over the RIA tunnels is done by the PE VRF but these HC measurements are valid for all VRFs since tunnels are multi-vrf
# HC for .8 and .9 over BLUE_1 are done by the VRF 3
# Two policy routes are used in the WAN-VRF to ensure that the HC received from BLUE_0 egresses over Internet_1 for .8
# and egresses over Internet_2 for .9
# These two HC (SLA_Internet and SLA_Internet2) allows to measure the quality of Internet_1 and Internet_2 from the standpoint
# of VRF3 via BLUE_1
# "set sla-compare-method number" is mandatory to have the desired behavior:
# . If Internet_1 goes off SLA, Internet traffic from VRF3 stays DIA over BLUE_1 and is routed by WAN-VRF over Internet_2
# . If both Internet_1 and _2 are off SLA, Internet traffic from VRF3 goes RIA via its local tunnels in VRF3
#
# Note:
# I tried another solution which consists in having a single default route in VRF3 over BLUE_1 and push all Internet traffic
# for VRF3 to the WAN-VRF which was also the PE VRF: Internet_1, Internet_2 and all tunnels were in this WAN+PE VRF.
# I though that the WAN+PE VRF would take care of deciding whether traffic goes DIA or RIA since it has all links and all HC
# The problem arises when Internet traffic from VRF3 must go RIA because both Internet links are off SLA
# When it happens, the Internet traffic is SNATed in VRF3 with the inter-vrf link IP address (10.254.254.x), it ingresses
# the WAN+PE VRF in BLUE_0 and is sent to the desired RIA tunnel (say, H1_MPLS). Problem is on the other side, on the Hub.
# The Hub receives in the PE VRF (VRF 32 !!!) the SNATed traffic from VRF3.
# The traffic fails RPF.
# I could have tweaked the Hub to accept traffic from 10.254.254.0/24 (inter-vrf subnets on the Branches) but this is
# ugly for multiple reasons:
# 1- conceptually it means that Internet traffic from VRF3 over corporate tunnels is carried in another VRF (32) -- this one is a "ok, why not... it's similar to DIA"
# 2- it exposes the inter-vrf subnet of the branch: they should be local and could even be in link-local subnet 169.254.x.x
# 3- the logs generated on the Hub would not allow to know which hosts were doing RIA because they are all SNATed -- this one is the most problematic
# So I stopped going this direction
# Note that Dmitry tool this direction: he sends DIA and RIA via inter-vrf to PE+WAN-VRF (same VRF 32)
# then the choice of DIA or RIA is made in VRF32 to go DIA or RIA
# He probobly fixed point 2- RPF with default-route on Hub towards tunnels
# He takes assumption that point 3- NAT is accepted by customer which is where I don't think it would be accepted

# SD-WAN rules for Overlay:
# ------------------------
# rules 1 and 2 leverages AppCtrl routing while rule 3 has no AppCtrl
# during learning phase, rule 1 and 2 cannot be matched which means learning traffic hits rule 3
# and can get sent out members "111 122 133 14" depending on SLA conditions
# learning traffic will hit firewall policy 3 (Corporate Out) which has AppCtrl enabled
# and therefore allows to populate 5-tuple for appctrl isdb cache
#
# SD-WAN rules for Internet underlay:
# ----------------------------------
# rules 5 and 6 (members 1 2 133 233) leverage AppCtrl routing while rule 7 (members 1 2) has no AppCtrl
# during learning phase, rule 5 and 6 cannot be matched which means learning traffic hits rule 7
# and can get sent out members "1 2" (DIA) depending on SLA conditions
# learning traffic will hit firewall policy 2 (Internet DIA) which has AppCtrl enabled
# and therefore allows to populate 5-tuple for appctrl isdb cache
# subsequent traffic to dstip-dport in appctrl cache can hit sdwan rules 5 or 6 and can be sent out members "1 2 133 233"
# depending on SLA conditions and can be allowed by firewall policies 2 (Internet DIA) or 5 (Internet RIA)
# AppCtrl is enabled on firewall policy 5 (Internet RIA) because if all DIA Internet links go down
# then traffic will hit FIB (rule 7 is ignored) and will hit RIA FW policy 5.
# If no AppCtrl was configured on RIA FW policy 5 then all Internet traffic will be subject to regular FIB lookup
# and sdwan rules 5/6 (prefer H1_MPLS over H2_MPLS) would never be matched since 5-tuple would never be populated
#
# A rule of thumb could be: Enable AppCtrl on all FW policies which have egress interfaces that leverage AppCtrl routing at sdwan layer.
