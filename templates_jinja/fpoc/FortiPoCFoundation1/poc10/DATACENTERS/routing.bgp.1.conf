#
# CONTEXT:
# - Legacy ADVPN with BGP RR
# - No BGP aggregation is allowed because ADVPN is done intra-region and inter-region:
#    . BGP Next-Hop convergence with exchange-interface-ip
#    . Intra-regional and Cross-region shortcuts are desired
#
# Solution:
# - eBGP between regions
# - cross-region ADVPN: BGP NH are preserved cross-region with eBGP 'next-hop-unchanged'
# - intra-region + cross-region ADVPN: each Branch receives all LAN prefixes from all other branches (same region and other region)
# - All branches must be able to resolve the BGP NH of all other branches
#   -> must receive the global loopback summary 10.200.0.0/16
# - the BGP global loopback summary (10.200.0.0/16) is advertised to Edges but not advertised to other region
#   -> community 'no-export' is attached to the global loopback summary
# - advertise the regional loopback summary (eg, 10.200.1.0/24) to the peering region with 'no-advertise' so that the
#   peering region does not re-advertise this summary

# Regional loopback summary (10.200.1.0/24 for WEST region, 10.200.2.0/24 for EAST region)
