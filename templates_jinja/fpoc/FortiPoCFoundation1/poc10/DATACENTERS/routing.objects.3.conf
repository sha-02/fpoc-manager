# CONTEXT = No ADVPN for VRF2, ADVPN is only for port5.VRF and VRF1
#
# - "No ADVPN" can mean two things:
#   (1) There will not be any branch-to-branch traffic (e.g, ATMs in VRF2)
#       In this case, VRF2 branches simply need to receive the subnets from the DataCenters (10.{1|2|4}.0.0/16)
#       For simplicity, we can also simply send a global LAN summary (10.0.0.0/8) to the VRF2 branches
#   (2) There should hardly be any branch-to-branch traffic (but it can happen)
#       VRF2 branches need to reach the DC subnets but also other branches in VRF2
#       The global LAN summary (eg, 10.0.0.0/8) is sent
#
# - HUBS must advertise a global LAN summary route (10.0.0.0/8) into VRF2 EDGE
#   as well as a summary route for its DataCenter (W-DC1 = 10.1.0.0/26, W-DC2= 10.2.0.0/16)
#   these two DC-specific subnets are needed because the SD-WAN rule mixes DC1+DC2 with 'fib-best-match'
#   so we need a more specific route for each DC in order to send the traffic to the correct DC
# - These summaries (global LAN and DCs LANs) must not be advertised to other regions -> restricted with 'no-export' community
# - HUB must filter VPNV4 prefixes with RT 65000:2 towards the EDGE
# - But the summary routes, which also have RT 65000:2 must be allowed so the summary is tagged with 'tag 32768'
#   when it is injected to BGP
# - summaries are added by means of static blackhole routes because:
#   . it is not possible to apply a route-map when creating an aggregate so cannot add tag 32768
#   . if an aggregate is used, the summary is not limited to VRF2

# Inject the summary routes (10.0.0.0/8, 10.{1|2}.0.0/16) in VRF2 into the BGP table
# Add 'no-export' so that these summaries are only announced to EDGE (iBGP) and not announced to another REGION (eBGP)
# Add tag 32768 to indicate that this is a locally originated prefix
