# location-id is sent by branch to Hub during IKEv2 AUTH
# Use case: there are multiple IPsec tunnels from Branch terminated on the same dialup phase1-interface on Hub
# Hub's behavior:
# - all tunnels connecting to the same phase1-interface are grouped together if they have the same location-id.
# - In order to reply symmetrically, original incoming tunnel is cached in session.
# - For outgoing traffic, FOS does not necessarily use the tunnel returned by the routing lookup to send.
#   Instead, FOS tries to pick original incoming tunnel from the group to send.
#
# There is no real need for location-id in this PoC since no branch terminates multiple tunnels to the same phase1
# on the Hub. But I've configured location-id in a some kind of "provisioning" or "don't forget the feature" idea
# Here, I'm using the BGP RID as location-id
