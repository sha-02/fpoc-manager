# If no remote signaling is done then SNAT must be used to guarantee that the return traffic from the Core goes back to the origin Hub.
# Using SNAT implies that existing TCP sessions cannot be failed over from one Hub to the other.
# If this is an unacceptable condition then SNAT is not an option and “remote signaling” must be done instead.
#
# If the lack of failover for existing TCP sessions is acceptable:
#     • Best Quality rules (mode priority) are not possible.
#       With a ‘best quality’ rule like [H1_INET H2_INET] new sessions would go to either H1 or H2 depending on the best link.
#       It is not possible with SNAT on Hubs.
#
#     • Blackout-only is an option: all links to H1 must be sla-dead (ie, loss of routing) to move traffic over H2
#         ◦ [H1_INET, H1_MPLS min-link=0] followed by  [H2_INET, H2_MPLS]
#           The drawback is that new sessions will be created via H1 links even if all links to H1 are out-sla
#
#     • mode-sla brownout (includes blackout): a minimum of healthy link must exists to H1 to keep traffic to H1.
#         If there is not enough in-sla min-links to H1 then traffic moves to H2
#         ◦ [H1_INET1, H1_INET2, H1_MPLS, H2_INET1, H2_INET2, H2_MPLS]
#             If all links to H1 are out-sla then traffic moves to H2
#         ◦ [H1_INET1, H1_INET2, H1_MPLS min-link=2] followed by [H2_INET1, H2_INET2, H2_MPLS]
#             If less than two links are in-sla to H1 (only one link is in-sla) then traffic moves to H2
#
# This kind of strategy works great for new sessions but breaks existing sessions: we don’t want existing sessions to attempt moving
# from H1 to H2 when H1 links are out-sla, because the sessions will fail.
# A possible solution is to force sessions to stick to their original link (eg, H1_INET1 or H1_INET2, etc…) with “preserve-session-route”.
# This fixes one problem for existing sessions, they will stay on original Hub.
# But it creates sub-optimal behavior for new and existing sessions: they connect move to another link towards the same Hub
# if current link becomes out-sla.
#
# Because traffic is SNATed by H1/H2 to CORE then
# - only new TCP sessions can failover from H1_ links to H2_ links towards CORE
# - existing TCP sessions must continue flowing through the original Hub
#
# The approach taken here is *blackout-only failover*
