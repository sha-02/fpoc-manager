# location-id is sent by branch to Hub during IKEv2 AUTH
# Use case: there are multiple IPsec tunnels from Branch terminated on the same dialup phase1-interface on Hub
# Hub's behavior:
# - all tunnels connecting to the same phase1-interface are grouped together if they have the same location-id.
# - In order to reply symmetrically, original incoming tunnel is cached in session.
# - For outgoing traffic, FOS does not necessarily use the tunnel returned by the routing lookup to send.
#   Instead, FOS tries to pick original incoming tunnel from the group to send.
#
# location-id is needed in this PoC since each branch connects mutiple times to the same dialup phase1 of the Hub
# due to the full-mesh of Internet IPsec tunnels between a Branch and its Hub
# Here, I'm using the BGP RID / loopback-IP as location-id

config system settings
    set location-id {{loopback}}
end

{% if vrf_aware_overlay %}
# subnet overlap needed for having the same subnet on the inter-vrf interfaces

# subnet overlap needed for having static overlay IP@ with cross-underlay tunnels (H1_INET1X2, H1_INET2X1, ...)
