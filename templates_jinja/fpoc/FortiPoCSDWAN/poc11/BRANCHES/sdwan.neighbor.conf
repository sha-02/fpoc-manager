### SD-WAN neighbors -----------------------------------------------

# Must be defined after BGP config

# This is only needed if a Banch wants to use route-map-out and route-map-out-preferrable towards the Hub
# There are use cases where it can be needed on the Hub even if SLA status is propagated via remote-sla
# e.g., when the Hub must propagate this SLA information/reacheability to the Core Network

#config system sdwan
#    config neighbor
#        edit "10.200.{{region_id}}.254"
#            set health-check "SLA_DataCenters"
#            set member 111 122 133 211 222 233
#            set minimum-sla-meet-members 1
#            set sla-id 1
#        next
#        edit "10.200.{{region_id}}.253"
#            set health-check "SLA_DataCenters"
