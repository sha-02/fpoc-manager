# Single BGP peering per Edge over loopback

{% block bgp_edge_loopback %}
#
# CONTEXT:

# Branches (eg, WEST-BR1) receive the LAN of their own DCS (10.1.0.0/24, 10.2.0.0/24 for WEST-DC1/2)
# and the corporate LAN summary (10.0.0.0/8) to reach every other networks from local and remote regions

# Routes received from other regions are marked as 'no-advertise' because they must not be re-advertised to Edges.
# Edges reach the local region and remote regions via the corporate summary (10.0.0.0/8)
# Edges must also receive the subnets of their DCs (10.1.0.0/16 and 10.2.0.0/16 for West)

# Tag-based resolution ('merge') is required with this bgp-on-loopback design:
# (1) on DCs to which shortcuts can be established (branches from a remote region building shortcut to the DC),
#     in this PoC this scenario is only when cross_region_advpn is True
# (2) on DCs which can reach branches of a remote region via summary routes from multiple DCs of the remote region
#     in this PoC this is always True for EAST-DC1 because:
#     - without bgp_aggregation: regional loopback summaries are received from WEST-DC1/DC2
#     - with bgp_aggregation: regional LAN summaries are received from WEST-DC1/DC2
#     For WEST-DC1/DC2 this is never True because they connect to a single DC in EAST region
#
# For configuration simplification, tag-based resolution is always enabled on WEST-DC1/DC2, no attempt is made to only
# configure tag-based resolution when only cross_region_advpn is True

# ADVPNv2.0 control UDP packets must be able to transit from a WEST-BRx loopback to a EAST-BRx loopback via the regional Hubs
# So the regional Hubs must know the loopback summary of its peering region
# E.g., WEST-DC1 must announce 10.200.1.0/24 to EAST-DC1
# These loopback summaries are only for the Hub themselves, they are not sent to any branch

# I think this is no longer needed in 7.4.4, so I remove it and I will see during my test if it is ok
