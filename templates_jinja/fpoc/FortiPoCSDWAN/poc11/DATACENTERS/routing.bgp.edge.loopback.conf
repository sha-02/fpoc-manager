# Single BGP peering per Edge over loopback
#

{% extends "./routing.bgp.conf" %} {# shared jinja variables needed for BGP #}
{% block bgp_edge_loopback %}
#
# CONTEXT:

# Branches (eg, WEST-BR1) receive the LAN of their own DCS (10.1.0.0/24, 10.2.0.0/24 for WEST-DC1/2)
# and the corporate LAN summary (10.0.0.0/8) to reach every other networks from local and remote regions

# Routes received from other regions are marked as 'no-advertise' because they must not be re-advertised to Edges.
# Edges reach the local region and remote regions via the corporate summary (10.0.0.0/8)
# Edges must also receive the subnets of their DCs (10.1.0.0/16 and 10.2.0.0/16 for West)

# Tag-based resolution (tag-resolve-mode) is no longer needed with the combination of ADVPNv2.0 and BGP summaries
# This is because a Branch (eg, WEST-BR1) now reaches another branch via the summary (eg, 10.0.0.0/8) received from
# WEST-DC1 and WEST-DC2. These two 10.0.0.0/8 summaries have WEST-DC1 and WEST-DC2 as BGP Next-Hop (first hop).
# There is no longer the need for WEST-BR1 to resolve the far away BGP NH of WEST-BR2 via the BGP loopback summaries
# received from WEST-DC1 & WEST-DC2. The recursive resolution issue via loopback summaries can no longer happen.
# Tag-based resolution is not needed so long as there is no need for resolving far away BGP NH via multiple summaries
# received from different sources.

# ADVPNv2.0 direct shortcut negotiation (7.4.4+) allows a branch to directly issue a shortcut-query to another branch
# (via the Hub)
# So the QUERY is self triggered without data traffic passing through Hub and without Hub sending OFFER
# The QUERY contains the loopback IP of the initiating branch and the loopback IP of the destination branch
# (eg, 10.200.1.1 -> 10.200.2.1, WEST-BR1 to EAST-BR1)
# So the regional Hubs must know the loopback summary of its peering region
# E.g., WEST-DC1 must announce 10.200.1.0/24 to EAST-DC1
# These regional loopback summaries are only exchanged between the Hubs, they are not sent to branches
#
# Not sure if an initiating Branch must have a route to the loopback IP of the receiving Branch
# Maybe it is needed, maybe not
# Anyway, in this Lab, the Corporate summary (10.0.0.0/8) covers the global loopback summary (10.200.0.0/16)
# so there is no need to advertise 10.200.0.0/16 to the Branches
# And, somehow, this is also covered by the default-route over every tunnel

# Only send local LAN and Corporate summaries to the Branches (these prefixes are tagged 32768 and 1918 respectively)
