# Static BGP neighbor to other regions (BGP on loopback)
#

# inter-region is based on eBGP on loopback which implies:
# - a single BGP peering on loopback between two DCs over all overlays (INET1, INET2, MPLS)
# - set ebgp-enforce-multihop enable
# - set update-source "lo-BGP"
# - set ebgp-multipath enable because there are multiple paths to reach the peer's loopback
# - Only local DCs prefixes are needed on a Branch (BR1/BR2 needs to know about DC1/DC2 ; BR3 needs to know about DC3)
# - Prefixes from other regions (edges and DCs) are aggregated under summary 10.0.0.0/8 which covers all LAN/DC subnets
# -  summary 10.0.0.0/8 is advertised to edges via a static route with 'set tag 1918'

# Regional LAN summarization is not done for remote region because it is not very common. Very few customers have
# a nice IP plan which allows to summarize each region below a small set of subnets
# Ideally the Hub/DC of a region would advertise a LAN summary for its whole region to other regions.
# However, the address plan rarely allows to summarize region-A and region-B without overlap.
# So, here, WEST-DC1/DC2 send all there edge subnets to EAST-DC (and same from EAST-DC to WEST-DC1/DC2)
# The corporate summary route 10.0.0.0/8 is not advertised from one region to another
# it is filtered by a route-map-out based on the fact that it contains 'tag 1918'

# Routes learned from East region (EAST-DC1, EAST-BR1) by WEST Hubs must not be advertised to West Edges.
# Only the corporate summary (10.0.0.0/8) is sent to West branches.
# Branches of one region do not need to know details about other regions
# This is done with a route-map-out towards the Branch which only allow prefixes with 'tag 1918' (corporate summary)
# and prefixes with 'tag 32768' (local LAN tagged during import with 'network' command)
# So only corporate summaries and local LAN are advertised down to Edges

# community 'no-advertise' is used to mark routes received from another region
# Technically this is not needed since filtering to Edge is controlled with tags
# But it allows to prevent EAST-DC1 to re-advertise the prefixes it learned from WEST-DC2 to WEST-DC1
# WEST-DC1 ignores them (because they contain its own ASN 65001 -BGP split horizon-)
# but it is nice to prevent this re-advertisement from happening since there is no need in this design to re-advertise
# the route from another region
