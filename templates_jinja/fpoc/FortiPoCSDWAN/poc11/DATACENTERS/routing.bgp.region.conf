# Static BGP neighbor to other regions (BGP on loopback)
#

# inter-region is based on eBGP on loopback which implies:
# - a single BGP peering on loopback between two DCs over all overlays (INET1, INET2, MPLS)
# - set ebgp-enforce-multihop enable
# - set update-source "lo-BGP"
# - set ebgp-multipath enable because there are multiple paths to reach the peer's loopback
# - Only local DCs prefixes are needed on a Branch (BR1/BR2 needs to know about DC1/DC2 ; BR3 needs to know about DC3)
# - Prefixes from other regions (edges and DCs) are aggregated under summary 10.0.0.0/8 which covers all LAN/DC subnets
# -  summary 10.0.0.0/8 is advertised to edges via a BGP aggregate

# Regional LAN summarization is not done for remote region because it is not very realistic. Very few customers have
# a nice IP plan which allows to summarize each region below a small set of subnets
# Ideally the Hub/DC of a region should advertise a summary for its whole region to other regions.
# For e.g., DC3 would get a summary for West region from DC1 and DC2. Then DC3 would pass this summary to its edges
# Often the address plan does not allow to summarize region-A and region-B without overlap.
# So, here, DC1/DC2 send all there edge subnets to DC3 which summarize them in a big 10.0.0.0/8 summary which is the
# "corporate summary" which encompasses all corporate subnets of all regions.
# Ideally, this corporate summary routes 10.0.0.0/8 should not be advertised to other regions but I did not bother
# creating a route-map entry to filter it out other regions because in each region the 10.0.0.0/8 summary is
# self-generated (aggregate) and has a BGP weight of 32768 so it takes precedence over any other aggregate received
# from any other region

# Routes learned from East region (EAST-DC1, EAST-BR1) by WEST Hubs must not be advertised to West Edges.
# Only the corporate summary (10.0.0.0/8) is sent to West branches.
# Branches of one region do not need to know details about other regions
# community 'no-advertise' is used to mark routes received from another region.
